# 🎬 Video Streaming Platform – Backend

![Video Streaming Backend Banner](./public/temp/banner.png)

A modular, production-grade backend built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**, powering core features of a video streaming application — from secure user authentication and file uploads to channel subscriptions, commenting, and video lifecycle management.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **JWT-based Authentication** with refresh token support
- 📹 **Video Management**: Upload, update, publish, thumbnail editing & deletion
- 🖼️ **User Profiles**: Avatar & cover image uploads with profile editing
- 🔔 **Subscriptions**: Toggle subscribe/unsubscribe with aggregation metadata
- 💬 **Commenting System**: Add/edit/delete video comments
- 📊 **Watch History Tracking** per user
- 📂 **Secure File Uploads** via `multer` (cloud-ready schemas)
- ⚠️ **Centralized Error Handling** with `ApiError` class and `GlobalErrorHandler`
- 🧾 **Versioned API**: `/api/v1/` for maintainability and future upgrades
- ❤️ **Like System**: Track user likes on videos and/or comments
- 🎶 **Playlists**: Users can create and manage video playlists
- 📁 **Modular Utilities**: Cloud upload service, response wrappers, constants
- 🧹 **Async Error Handling** with `asyncHandler` to eliminate try-catch clutter

## 🛠️ Utility Layer

- `ApiError` / `ApiResponse`: Unified response and error interface
- `asyncHandler`: Clean async route wrapping
- `cloudinary.service.js`: Abstraction for media upload handling
- `UtilityMethods.js`: Reusable helpers and computed logic
- `constants.js`: Centralized values and enums

## 🔐 Auth Flow Overview

- On login/register: Access + refresh tokens generated and returned
- Protected routes require `verifyJWT` middleware
- Refresh flow handled securely via token storage in DB
- Role enforcement via `verifyVideoAuthor`, etc.

---

## 📊 Aggregation Capabilities

Used MongoDB aggregation pipelines to:

- Count channel subscribers and subscribed channels
- Determine if current viewer is subscribed
- Flatten subscription logic for profile enrichment
- Track and retrieve user watch history
- Paginate video results efficiently
